When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my files with other people and/or to be able to access my files from another computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because in case of automatical pull to the local repository it can be that Git
pulls uncompleted features and fixes.

Decribe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks are the copies of repository on GitHub that are also stored on GitHub
and have links to the original repositories. Clones are just local copies of
local or remore repositories. Branches are the way to separate commits related
to realisation of some feature. Forks are used to clone someone's GitHub
repository to work with it but have a link to the origin. Clones are used to
just copy repositories. And branches are used to store commits in convenient
way that allows to work on logically separated versions of files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

The benefit is that you can always see what commits were added after the last
pull request

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

It would be harder because there will be a need to share my files somehow and
do a lot of manual work with comparisons and so on.
