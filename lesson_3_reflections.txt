When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my files with other people and/or to be able to access my files from another computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because in case of automatical pull to the local repository it can be that Git
pulls uncompleted features and fixes.
