What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

In this case Git creates hidden folder '.git' that contains special metadata. 
I need this to start tracking my files in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains only chosen files from working directory and and is a kind
of temporary place for storing files that chosen to be added to commit.
I think it offers the value of ability to choose which files should be commited.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add to the staging area only those files than were edited during the adding one logical change
